Abstract:
Fake News has become one of the most important issues in modern India. Fake News is not a new phenomenon, though. It has been started in ancient Greece. This fake news has spread worldwide, and in countries with a bit lower literacy rate, it has become a threat.
Fake news is mostly spread over social media applications like Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram, etc. In India, almost 35 crores of citizens use social media applications, among which approximately 20 crores Indians use WhatsApp alone. Thus people who create fake news have chosen WhatsApp as the main way to spread fake news.
Political parties or online article publishers share fake news that looks true to fulfill their agenda and grow business, respectively. But, recently, Facebook, YouTube, and a few other apps have taken steps and created algorithms to refute fake news. We all must educate others too to help them identify fake news. 
To identify the Fake news we are using CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) to classify the fake news images from the real ones. Using CNN in an optimized way we can filter the fake news and real news easily. To use CNN in an optimized way we are using Genetic Algorithm concepts as basics of how they work.

Introduction:
In today’s world, fake news has become a serious threat to many people. Fake News can be any news, story, or hoax that misinform people or deceive the readers. Social media apps like Facebook, Instagram, and even Google are how fake news is growing. Fake News can be created by any political party, too, to push various political agendas. These kinds of false information reach the common people and thus affect the free speech and informed choices of the country’s subjects. Fake News leads to the hijacking of the democracy of any country. Fake News is not a new thing that is rising with the growth of India’s social media applications. From ancient Greece, the governments and people who were in the business of mobilizing public opinion always invested in campaigns to spread wrong information intentionally to build their own choices of narratives. There are various causes behind the spread of fake news in India. In today’s India, news media and their journalists are no longer seen arbitrating real news or creating news neutrally. These news media allegedly act as the echo-chambers of the dominant political parties. Fighting against this fake news can be dealt with three prongs: rebuttal, removal of fake news, and educating the public. Technical companies like Facebook and YouTube use high-level coding language to create algorithms that help remove fake news from their respective social media platforms. WhatsApp has also limit messages you can forward so that you can’t forward unlimited texts that can include fake news. Using CNN in an optimized way we can filter the fake news and real news easily. To use CNN in an optimized way we are using Genetic Algorithm concepts.

Existing Methods: 
A Convolutional neural network (CNN) is a neural network that has one or more convolutional layers and are used mainly for image processing, classification, segmentation and also for other auto correlated data.
The main advantage of CNN compared to its predecessors is that it automatically detects the important features without any human supervision. For example, given many pictures of cats and dogs it learns distinctive features for each class by itself. They are trained quicker and gives satisfactory accuracy of classifying.
But the consumption of resources are directly proportional to the accuracy of the classifier. 

Proposed Methods: 
So to reduce the consumption of resources, we let the network which activation sigma, pooling layers and hyper parameters are added on its own based on the mutations per generation.
The generations and mutational ways are learnt from referring each of the pre-existing genetic algorithms concepts such as Ant Colony Optimization, Swarm Intelligence, Bat Algorithm, and other evolutionary concepts which is are learnt for scholar papers which are added in the reference session.’
They are so effective that there is no direct optimization algorithm, allowing the possibility to have extremely varied results. The process is slow but optimizes performance as neural network gets adapted to the process which is the outcome produced by cross referring two neural network and providing a better CNN.

Methodology:
1) Loading and preprocessing dataset
The dataset used is Cifar10 which is downloaded from Kaggle dataset repository. The dataset is divided into 10 classes where sample labelled image is given as fake one to be classified. We will be using keras utils, to_categorical and numpy for pre-processing procedure.

2) Splitting data
The dataset loaded is shaped and splited into train dataset and validation set so that model can be tuned to validation set based on the generation of genetic algorithm settled.

3) Setting up Genetic Algorithm
Genetic algorithm is first initialized with parameters which are selected based on random process. Particular generation of population is developed. Based on the fitness of the generation model will evaluate and selection of the offspring are taken. Crossover happens based on the parents of the generation based on mutation. Total 3 generations with number of population of 10 and threshold value 90 is taken and implemented.

4) Setting and training the model
Model will be trained based on chromosomes of each generation and accuracy will be evaluated based on the fitness of the generation. Training data and validation data will be passed based on the labelled dataset. The model will stop training when the generation of 3 gets over where the accuracy will be increased per generation. For callback function we are using Early Stopping in Keras which helps us to specify the performance of resources used which is configured when instantiated.

5) Model deployment
After training, the maximum accuracy reached for 3 generation is 77% of 0.6 standard deviation of accuracy per generation. If we increase the generation maximum accuracy can be increased.

Conclusion: 
The model got an accuracy of 77% in the 3rd generation. The training took 1 hour and the model was pretty accurate using the Genetic algorithm in Sequential CNN. This model can be developed further to predict the fake news where it will be spread. However, sample image of the source is required as it is supervised machine learning model. The output of the model was improved by training the model again and again by reducing the resource utilization. Thus, we have successfully accomplished the objective to detect fake news image using CNN optimized by genetic algorithm concepts.
